## Introduction

This presentation is created for the final project of the Data Science Capstone course. 

For this final project, a model that can predict words in a text is created, and a shiny app user-interface is made based on this model to allow people to predict the most commonly used word following a target word.

## Obtaining and Cleaning the data

**Data is first obtained, and then cleaned prior to any exploratory analysis and prediction model-building**
- 3 samples were randomly selected from a subset of data collected from blogs, twitter and news, then they are merged into a single sample set. 
- After this, data cleaning procedures are conducted. This includes converting all text into lower case, cleaning empty space, and removing numbers as well as punctuations.
- Then, a set of correspnding n-grams are created.
- The count tables for each term is obtained from the N-gram files, and they are sorted according to their frequency of appearance, and finally comparessed into RData files. 

## Predictive Text Model

The predictive model is build from the sampled created earlier, which includes around 800,000 lines of texts from a variety of soruces. 

The sample data is tokenized and cleaned, and a algorithm tries to detect a match between the longest n-gram (4-gram) to the shortest 2-gram. Basically, 4-gram is first used, then trigram, then 2-gram or bigram.The predictive next word is considered using the longest, and the most frequently mathced n-gram. 

## Shiny Application
```{r}
library(knitr)
```

```{r figurename, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Shiny Application", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("graph.png")
```
